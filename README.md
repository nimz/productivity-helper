# productivity-helper
An application to track one's productivity during work sessions.

This application helps you track your productivity during a work session by pressing buttons depending on what you are doing.
To begin your work session, press the "Start Working" button. If you go on a break, hit the "Go On Break" button. Make sure
to hit "End Break" when you get back. Finally, if you aren't officially going on a break but notice yourself getting the urge
to slack off, hit the "Slack Off" button so you can track how much time you waste. When you are ready to get back to work, hit
the "Get Back to Work!" button. This application logs the time periods that you spend in each state (working, breaking,
and slacking). You can also view statistics on this information by clicking View > Statistics in the top menu.

To download this application on Mac, clone the git directory and open the .xcodeproj file. Build it in XCode. In the future,
this application will be made available in pre-built format, so that users do not need XCode or have to build anything.

TODO: Improve statistics display, improve visual interface of application, clean up code, add useful comments.
